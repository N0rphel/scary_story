            <h1>My New Neighbour</h1>
            <p>
                It’s been two weeks since the noises began. Every time the clock strikes 1.05 in the witching hour, like clockwork, the stomping come alive. The ceiling has cracked from the constant and rhythmic beat of the stomping. I’ve spoken to the landlord already. He promised to talk some sense into my neighbours, some pair of hippies with dreadlocks and weird as fuck tattoos. They moved in two months ago. The husband, although dressed as if in some cult, seemed like a chill guy the last time we crossed paths in front of the apartment. The wife? Honestly, all I know about her is limited to what I’ve heard the other neighbours say. From my humble understanding, both husband and wife lead a yoga studio of some kind downtown and are people of few words.

                Things started to go downhill a month ago. While it didn’t happen so frequently, I would see the husband either exiting the apartment or taking out the trash. But I stopped seeing him after that night. I was washing the dishes when I noticed that my pipes had become clogged. The plumber I called said the issue was coming from upstairs and that our pipes were connected since this particular apartment was one of those few that hadn’t been renovated back in 2016 due to some legal issues with one of the tenants at the time. He managed to unclog it though but warned that it would probably happen again if I didn’t do anything about it. Not to talk about that foul smell…

                I contacted my landlord and we figured that the best course of action was to inform my new neighbours about the issues with the pipes and politely ask them not to drain oils or other kinds of stuff that could get these old rusty pipes clogged.
