                There was still no sight of either the husband or the wife for several weeks. I had just been promoted at work and would be able to move out to a nicer neighbourhood by the end of the year. To celebrate my upgrade, I went out with my friends and boyfriend to a bar. We were having a great time and I ended up spending the night over at my boyfriend. I don’t recall how our conversation ended up in this direction, but as we cuddled in bed, he told me something that I failed to notice myself. That entire night, he said, quote, a weird guy was watching you, end quote. When I asked what he meant by weird, he said that he had dirty blond dreadlocks, dark makeup under his eyes, and tattoos all over his neck. But that wasn’t even the scariest part. My boyfriend noticed that the hippie guy was hiding something under his sweatshirt. That was why he asked me to come home with him that night.

                I should’ve told my boyfriend that I knew the guy. I still don’t understand why I didn’t just tell him and say I was afraid. But that’s how far the weirdness got. Nothing happened for weeks. I figured my neighbour must’ve seen me outside the bar but was too shy to approach and say hello. It wouldn’t be the first time something like this happened. While I wouldn’t consider myself an attractive person, I had a look that drew people in the more they saw me. Naturally, my boyfriend stayed over a few times after this incident in case I was stalked by some weirdo, but it didn’t last for long. He had to be out of town for work for the next two months due to an infrastructure project he was part of in another state. His team were responsible for the production of a 3D layout over a subway station for commuters between several states in the south. He didn’t exactly give me a return date but said the job should be done in no more than two months since they already had something to work with from a failed project from 2015.

                Then the stomping began.
