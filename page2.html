            Working a 9-5 office job the entire week, the only free time I had was on a Saturday afternoon. My sister had thrown a birthday party for my niece that day and I went over to her house in the early hours to help her out with the preparations. I got back home around 7 PM. As soon as I opened the front door, the stench hit me. Honestly, I had forgotten all about the clogged pipe thing, but when I twisted the tap and saw the water rise in the sink, I totally lost it.
            I waited like four whole minutes before they finally opened the door. I didn’t notice it at the time but he kept looking over his shoulder as I told him what had happened. He was very apologetic and promised that he’d speak to his wife about the clogged pipes. As he was about to close the door, I heard something and tried to look behind him, but he shut it close before I could. It sounded muffled, like someone trying to speak underwater, save it didn’t sound like a speech. How do I call it? Like how you’d think someone whose mouth is taped close would try to get your attention.

            The pipe issues stopped after that.
